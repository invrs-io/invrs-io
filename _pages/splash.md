invrs-io's mission is to accelerate photonic inverse design research with improved, open software. We envision an ecosystem of interoperable tools that evolves and expands as the field progresses. Our key contributions to this ecosystem include,

## invrs-gym
The [**invrs-gym**](https://invrs-io.github.io/gym/) is a collection of nanophotonic inverse design challenges with a common API. Gym challenges are based on real-world photonics design problems from fields such as imaging, AR/VR, and optical networking. The gym abstracts away the details of photonics and the underlying simulation, making it accessible to a broad range of researchers including optimization and AI scientists. For photonics designers, gym challenges serves a template for constructing new inverse design challenges.

## leaderboard
The [**leaderboard**](https://invrs-io.github.io/leaderboard/) is a datset of solutions to inverse design challenges, including results from multiple publications by several different research groups. Together with the gym, the leaderboard enables benchmarking of inverse design algorithms.

## invrs-opt
![levelset-optimization]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/levelset.gif){: .align-right} The [**invrs-opt**](https://github.com/invrs-io/opt/) package contains several optimizers suitable for nanophotonic inverse design.
